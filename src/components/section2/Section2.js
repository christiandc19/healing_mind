                <p>
                If you suffer from depression and have not seen significant improvement from traditional antidepressant medications like SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAOIS, our TMS Therapy may be a good solution for you. TMS Therapy doesn't use a drug, so there are no foreign compounds introduced to the body and it does not have the side effects typically associated with drug therapy.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                Symptoms typically associated with depression include a disinterest or lack of pleasure in daily activities, feeling down or hopeless, atypical sleep patterns or appetite, lethargy and low energy, low self-esteem, and difficulty concentrating. <br /><br /><span> If you are experiencing some or all of these symptoms and have not seen satisfactory improvement from traditional drug therapy, take our self assessment to find out if you might be a cadidate for TMS therapy.</span>
